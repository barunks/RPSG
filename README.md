Assessment
The purpose of this test is for you to show us your idea of the ideal solutions to these problems. Write code you would be proud to 
submit in the workplace; we will assess it with the same critical eye we apply to our own code.
 
Clear, simple and elegant object-oriented code is important. However, we do not want to see the minimum possible solution; 
you should consider maintainability and extensibility and demonstrate that you can make appropriate abstractions. 
A solution using the fewest possible lines of code is unlikely to pass the assessment.

# Problem Statement: Paper Scissors Rock
Paper Scissors Rock is a game for two players. Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display a symbol: 
Fist equals rock,Open hand equals paper,Showing the index and middle finger equals scissors. The winner is determined by the 
following schema: paper beats (wraps) rock,rock beats (blunts) scissors,scissors beats (cuts) paper. Write a program that plays 
Paper Scissors Rock between the computer and a real player.You should be able to play the game n times before the program exits. 
 
#  Guidelines
Generalise from these requirements as you wish and demonstrate that you can write clear, maintainable and extensible code.
 
As a guide, you should expect to spend approximately 3-4 hours for the combined test, but you may take as much time as you wish. 
Please return your responses to me (tarball of project source files only) by return email by Monday morning Please do not include any 
compiled files in the archive (e.g. .o, .obj, .a or executables for C++, .class or .jar for Java) If you do, it will be blocked by our 
email system.   

Pointers: They look for clean, well commented code that is easy to understand and work with, so..
Neat / Readable / OrganisedClean / Lean / Performance focusedReplaceableScalableMake sure your Implementations are extensible to 
other interfaces where applicableStrong OO principals & designInclude Unit Tests & Abstractions where applicable
